### Problem 2: The Mode
Statement: Given a list (array) of integers, determine the value of the mode and its frequency. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.

Input: size of the data set, followed a list of integers in the data set.

Output: value_of_mode frequency

Example
Input:
```
6 515752
```

Output:
```
5 3
```

1. Describe an algorithm for finding the mode of a data set.
2. Give pseudocode for your algorithm
3. Analysis of the running time of your algorithm.

## Activity 1 – Code: (10 pts)
Implement your algorithm for finding the mode in C++. The “extra credit” test cases have two modes since two different values appear with the greatest frequency. For example,

Input:
```
8 91979277
```

Output:
```
93 73
```
In the output the mode that appears first in the list should be outputted first. Note: That there is a newline (endl) after the output.

You can use the code template I provide. The name of file you submit to Gradescope must be **act1.cpp**. You may submit multiple times. Select all group member each time you submit and include the names of the group member in your comments.
